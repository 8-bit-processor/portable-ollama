Portable Ollama is a self contained app that eliminates all worry about systemwider conflict because this setup makes the entire application self-contained and portable, meaning you can run it without needing to install Ollama globally on your system or in a system that you may not want a systemwide installation.

For the ollama model- the blobs are the data, and manifests are the metadata how the data is used to constructing the functional language model

All communication happens on port 5000 and 11434 and is confined to the 127.0.0.1 loopback address

Build with ollama as a local support server to your app or directly within your app.
